## Study Tips

1. **Watch Videos First**: NeetCode provides excellent explanations - watch before coding
2. **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Focus on why the solution works
3. **Pattern Recognition**: After solving, identify the pattern used
4. **Spaced Repetition**: Revisit problems after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month
5. **Time Yourself**: Practice under interview conditions (45 min per problem)
6. **Explain Out Loud**: Verbalize your thought process
7. **Multiple Solutions**: Try brute force → optimized → optimal
8. **Edge Cases**: Empty input, single element, duplicates, negatives
