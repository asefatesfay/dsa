## Common Patterns to Master

1. **Two Pointers**: Array manipulation, palindromes, partitioning
2. **Sliding Window**: Subarray/substring problems with constraints
3. **Binary Search**: Search in sorted/rotated arrays, optimization problems
4. **DFS/BFS**: Tree/graph traversal, shortest paths
5. **Dynamic Programming**: Optimization, counting, subsequences
6. **Backtracking**: Permutations, combinations, constraint satisfaction
7. **Greedy**: Interval scheduling, optimization with local choices
8. **Divide & Conquer**: Sorting, tree construction
9. **Union Find**: Connected components, cycle detection
10. **Trie**: Prefix matching, word search

## Study Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with Easy problems to build confidence
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Group similar problems together
3. **Multiple Solutions**: Try brute force → optimized → optimal
4. **Time Management**: Aim to solve Easy (15 min), Medium (30 min), Hard (45+ min)
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Empty input, single element, duplicates, negatives
6. **Space-Time Tradeoff**: Consider both O(n) extra space and O(1) solutions
7. **Review Regularly**: Revisit problems after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month
