# Python Lists - Data Structures and Algorithms

This folder contains comprehensive learning materials for Python lists in the context of DSA.

## 📚 Files Overview

1. **01_basics.py** - Introduction to lists, creation, accessing, slicing
2. **02_operations.py** - Common list operations (append, insert, remove, sort, etc.)
3. **03_list_comprehension.py** - List comprehensions and elegant list creation
4. **04_common_patterns.py** - Important algorithmic patterns (two pointers, sliding window, etc.)
5. **05_practice_problems.py** - Solved common interview problems
6. **06_exercises.py** - Practice exercises for you to solve
7. **07_real_world_problems.py** - Real-world applications (shopping cart, social media, streaming, etc.)

## 🎯 Learning Path

1. Start with `01_basics.py` to understand list fundamentals
2. Move to `02_operations.py` to learn list methods and their time complexities
3. Study `03_list_comprehension.py` for Pythonic list creation
4. Master `04_common_patterns.py` - these patterns appear in many DSA problems
5. Review `05_practice_problems.py` to see solutions to common problems
6. Practice with `06_exercises.py` to test your understanding
7. Explore `07_real_world_problems.py` to see practical applications in real systems

## ⏱️ Time Complexities

| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|
| Access by index | O(1) |
| Append | O(1) |
| Insert | O(n) |
| Delete | O(n) |
| Search | O(n) |
| Sort | O(n log n) |
| Slice | O(k) where k is slice length |

## 💡 Key Concepts

- **Mutable**: Lists can be modified after creation
- **Ordered**: Elements maintain their insertion order
- **Dynamic**: Lists can grow and shrink as needed
- **Heterogeneous**: Can store different data types

## 🔥 Common Patterns

1. **Two Pointers**: Used for sorted arrays, palindromes, etc.
2. **Sliding Window**: For subarray problems with size k
3. **Prefix Sum**: For range sum queries
4. **Kadane's Algorithm**: Maximum subarray sum
5. **Dutch National Flag**: Three-way partitioning

## 🚀 Running the Code

```bash
# Run any file to see examples
python 01_basics.py
python 02_operations.py

# Practice exercises
python 06_exercises.py
```

## 📝 Next Steps

After mastering lists, you can move on to:
- Strings (similar to lists but immutable)
- Stacks (LIFO using lists)
- Queues (FIFO using lists or collections.deque)
- Linked Lists (more efficient insertions/deletions)

## 🎓 Tips

- Always consider time and space complexity
- Lists are great for sequential access but consider sets/dicts for lookups
- Use list comprehensions for cleaner, more Pythonic code
- Remember that slicing creates a copy of the data

Happy Learning! 🐍
